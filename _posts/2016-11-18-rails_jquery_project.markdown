It was really neat to see how you can use jQuery to refactor ruby code. It made my code a lot cleaner and more logical. There are more things I would like to go back and refactor about my code now that I know how to incorporate JavaScript and jQuery into my Rails framework. This project helped me to start to see how all of the pieces fit together to form complete web apps.
