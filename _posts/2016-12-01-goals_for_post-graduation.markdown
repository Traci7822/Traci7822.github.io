Now that i've submitted my final project I have a lot of goals that I would like to accomplish while going through the career track. I want to put together a really solid portfolio page with all of my best work presented. Firstly I will need to go back and spruce up all of the projects and make them more presentable. I also want to read a lot to deepen my understanding of the languages and frameworks i've already learned. I want to learn how to write tests more comfortably and keep making projects.
