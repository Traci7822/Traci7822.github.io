The culminating project of this program was certainly a difficult one. It took a lot of research and going back and restudying concepts that had been taught over the last few months. One of the hardest parts was figuring out how to connect the rails back-end functionality with Angular's front-end functionality. In hind-sight it wasn't actually that difficult to do, just difficult to figure out. There's still a lot I want to add to this project to make it nicer but I wanted to start with getting the basic functionality working before sprucing it up. I'd like to add pagination to the main stations table, enable more search and sorting features, and possibly even add a ratings component. I also plan to make the whole application look really nice and sharp using bootstrap and sass.
