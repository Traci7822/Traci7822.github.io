Recently I've been going back through my projects from the full stack curriculum and rebuilding them to have cleaner and clearer code. Building my projects the first time around was messy and confusing. Going back now though, I am able to sort through the logic I used and use the skills I have gained to build a more logical app, that is easier to follow throughout the code and easier to make changes and updates to. It's really neat to see what I've learned since they were originally built and also a really great way to solidify the knowledge that i've gained since starting them. It's nice to have code that you're proud of and know that someone can view it as clear and understandable.
