Going through the career track and looking for a job has me really evaluating what I really want out of this career. When I find a job I really want to apply to, I will take whatever measures necessary to make myself a viable candidate. This week I found a job I really wanted and they asked for me to submit code that I was proud of. I took the opportunity to expedite a project I was refactoring and spent most of the week making sure it was the best code I could submit. I implemented testing (something that had been on my to-do list to learn for a long time), flash messages (also on the to-do list for too long), and other skills that gave me the confidence to submit my project and feel like I stand a chance at getting the job.
