A few months ago I heard about an open-source project that I was eager to get involved with. I struck up a conversation with someone involved in the project (I had heard about this project and met this person at a meetup), got added to the project and went home excited about being a future contributor. A few days later I skimmed the repository and tried to familiarize myself with the code. A bit confusing, I decided i'd take a look again a bit later. Later became a few days and it was still confusing, I didn't know where to begin. I kept peeking at the code's issues now and then to see if anything popped up that seemed do-able for my first open-source contribution but nothing ever did. I continued to get email notifications when there were updates but my reaction soon became to just delete them and focus on whatever was more important to me at the moment. Last week I put '(project name), in or out?' on my to-do list to force myself to make a decision to contribute or not. I decided I was out. 

Two days later I attended a meetup. It was a Ruby project night and I was excited to jump in to something new. Much to my surprise, the group had adopted the very same project I was hoping to contribute to! After discussing and dividing the tasks of different issues with the project, we split up and began setting up our environments. It took the majority of the time there to get the environment up and running properly on my local machine, but fortunately I had some experienced guidance from the organizers of the group and I was now able to work on the code base! I'm fairly certain I would have had no idea how to navigate the install without the help I had and I never would have had that opportunity if I hadn't attended the meetup. I started writing tests for the project and am currently awaiting feedback on my first pull request. 

Just when I thought it was time to abandon something I wanted, I found the ability to make it happen within my community. Thanks meetup!
