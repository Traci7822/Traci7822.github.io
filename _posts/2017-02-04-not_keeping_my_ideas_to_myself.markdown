I recenly started a new project and had made little headway on it. I wrote down a lot of notes but had only begun to set up the framework. I had a bunch of ideas for how I want to the user experience to be, but no plan yet as to how I was going to make that happen. 

I'm a member of several Slack channels and fortunately as I was looking for inspiration, someone posted their portfolio site and after peeking around at it, I realized I really liked their design style and reached out to them to see if they wanted to collaborate on this new project of mine. 

I realize how valuable pair programming experiences can be and I realize that is something I haven't had as much time with as I would like. I look forward to the possibilty of collaboration on the project, and the idea of growing my idea along with someone else and learning from them and the experience.
