While I still feel totally green in this field, I've embraced a few volunteer opportunities that have presented themselves this last week. As of this next week I will be mentoring an Iraqi student going through this bootcamp and have also volunteered to be a teaching assistant for Girl Develop It, a community I am excited to get more engrained within. I think that even though I don't feel super confident in a lot of my skills, using these teaching roles will be a great way to reinforce what I know and understand concepts even more thoroughly so that I am able to help others to gain as well.
