Girl Develop It has been so helpful in my coding journey. Just this past week, I recieved a scholarship to attend a full day course on Intermediate HTMl & CSS. I would not have been able to attend the course without the scholarship so I am truly grateful for the opportunity to attend anyway thanks to the scholarship component of the GDI organization. It's so wonderful to get to experience all of the efforts being made to support women in this industry through GDI and other women focused groups.

Other women focused groups I participate in:

Women Who Code
Tech Ladies
Early Career Women TechMakers


Thank you to all the women and men creating and supporting these groups that lower the barrier to entry into the field of technology for other women.
