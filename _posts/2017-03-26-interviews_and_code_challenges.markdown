It can be discouraging thinking an interview went well or submitting a code challenge I thought looked great and still not getting that next interview in the process. This has happened a few times recently and despite the dissapointment when I get another rejection notification i'm trying to use this process to get some outside perspective. I enjoy code challenges because they test my knowledge and make me think about things in a way other than of my own design. I know the more rejections I get, the more my experience builds and the better candidate I become for that future right fit. It's only a matter of time...
